ScrambleRND
===========

Scramble is a classic shoot'em up from the 80's. You pilot a small ship over an alien landscape, shooting and bombing land targets as you move further into enemy territory. The aim of the game is to destroy the alien HQ at the end of the landscape.

This is the complete Blitzmax source to ScrambleRND, using Game2D as its framework. This version of Scramble has semi-randomized terrain for added variation.

You need the [Game2D](https://github.com/wiebow/game2d.mod) framework if you want to compile this game.
More information can be found on the game2d repository wiki and readme.md.

A compiled version of the game can be downloaded from [my blog](http://devdef.blogspot.nl).
